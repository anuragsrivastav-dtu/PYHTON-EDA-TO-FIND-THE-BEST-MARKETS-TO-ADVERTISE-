# TO FIND THE BEST MARKETS TO ADVERTISE
# About Dataset
freeCodeCamp is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run a popular Medium publication (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of our analysis. Dataset can be found in the Github repository: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey
# Objectiive of our Analysis
Most of the courses that freecodecamp offers are on web and mobile development, but they also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc.They want to promote their product and would like to invest some money in advertisement. Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in based upon the analysis that we undertoook.
# Conclusion of the Analysis
In this project, after analyzing the survey data from new coders to find the best two markets to advertise in, the only solid conclusion what we get is, the US would be a good market to advertise in.
